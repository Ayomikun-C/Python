raining = False

if not raining:
    print("Go outside and play!")
else:
    print("Stay inside!")
# Output: Stay inside!
# The output is Stay inside! because the raining variable is set to True.
# The if statement checks if the raining variable is not True, which is False.
# Since the raining variable is True, the else block is executed
# and the output is Stay inside!.
